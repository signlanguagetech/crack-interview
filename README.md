## üîÑ Development & Deployment

### Deployment Environments

This project uses a dual deployment strategy:
- **Preview (Surge.sh)**: Automatically deployed for each PR
- **Production (GitHub Pages)**: Deployed when changes reach the `main` branch

### Setting up Preview Deployments

To enable automatic PR previews:

1. **Generate a Surge token**
   ```bash
   npx surge token   # Or: pnpm exec surge token
   ```

2. **Configure in GitHub**
   - Go to repository Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
   - Add the following secrets:
     - `SURGE_TOKEN`: Your Surge.sh authentication token

For detailed troubleshooting, see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

### SEO and Social Sharing

The project includes:
- Open Graph meta tags for better social media sharing
- Structured data for improved search engine visibility
- Multilingual support with proper language tags
- Responsive design for all devices

> **Note**: You'll need to create and add an actual image file at `/public/og-image.jpg` for the `og:image` tag to work. This image should be:
> - At least 1200x630 pixels for optimal display on most social media platforms
> - Less than 1MB in file size
> - In JPG or PNG format
