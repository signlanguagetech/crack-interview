# Preview Environments with Surge.sh

This project uses GitHub Pages for production deployment and Surge.sh for Pull Request previews.

## Setting up Surge.sh for PR Previews

To enable automatic PR previews with Surge.sh:

1. **Create a Surge.sh account**
   ```
   npm install -g surge
   surge login
   ```

2. **Get your Surge.sh token**
   ```
   surge token
   ```

3. **Configure the secrets in GitHub**
   
   In your GitHub repository, go to Settings > Secrets > Actions and add:
   
   - `SURGE_TOKEN`: The token obtained in the previous step
   - `SURGE_LOGIN`: Your Surge.sh email address

## How It Works

- Each time a PR is created or updated, it's automatically deployed to a unique Surge.sh domain
- The workflow leaves a comment with the preview link on the PR
- When the PR is closed or merged, the preview is automatically removed

## Lifecycle

1. **PR Creation/Update**: Deployed to `https://pr-{number}-{repository}.surge.sh`
2. **PR Close/Merge**: Preview is automatically removed
3. **Production**: The main site is deployed to GitHub Pages when changes reach the `main` branch
