## Crucial Topics

### What is Node.js?

**Node.js** is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It allows developers to execute JavaScript on the server side. Node.js is built on the V8 engine, which is developed by Google, and uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it suitable for building scalable applications, especially for real-time systems.

### What is package.json?

**`package.json`** is the configuration file in a Node.js project. It contains metadata about the project such as its name, version, description, and scripts. It also includes information about the project's dependencies (`dependencies`) and development dependencies (`devDependencies`).



### How Event Loop works?

The **Event Loop** is the mechanism that makes Node.js non-blocking. Node.js executes tasks asynchronously using its event loop, and handles requests on a single-threaded architecture. The Event Loop processes tasks from different queues (timers, I/O callbacks, etc.), delegating heavy tasks to worker threads (via libuv) and executing JavaScript callbacks when the operation completes.



### Is Node.js entirely based on a single-thread?

No, while **Node.js** uses a single-threaded model for its event loop, it utilizes a thread pool internally via the `libuv` library to offload heavy tasks like file I/O, networking, or CPU-intensive computations.



### What kinds of streams does Node.js have?

**Node.js streams** are used for handling streaming data. The four types of streams are:

- **Readable Streams**: Used for reading data (e.g., `fs.createReadStream`).
- **Writable Streams**: Used for writing data (e.g., `fs.createWriteStream`).
- **Duplex Streams**: Used for both reading and writing (e.g., `net.Socket`).
- **Transform Streams**: Used for modifying or transforming data during streaming (e.g., `zlib.createGzip`).



### How do you understand the Callback Pattern? What is a callback hell?

The **Callback pattern** is a mechanism where a function is passed as an argument to another function and is called after a certain operation.

**Callback hell** refers to deeply nested callbacks that make code harder to read and debug. It can be avoided using modular coding, Promises, or async/await.



### What is a Promise?

**Promise** is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. With Promises, you can attach callbacks (`then`, `catch`) after an operation finishes.



### What states does the Promise have? Can the state be changed once it was fulfilled or rejected?

A **Promise** has the following states:

1. **Pending**: Initial state, operation not completed yet.
2. **Fulfilled**: Operation successfully completed.
3. **Rejected**: Operation failed.

Once a promise is fulfilled or rejected, its state cannot change further.



### What are the purposes for middlewares in Express.js?

**Express.js middlewares** are functions that process requests before sending a response. Purposes include:

- Handling authentication.
- Logging requests.
- Parsing request bodies (e.g., `body-parser`).
- Error handling.



### What is a test pyramid? How can you implement it regarding HTTP APIs?

A **Test Pyramid** is a testing strategy emphasizing different layers in tests:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components of the code.
- **Integration Tests**: Test components working together.
- **End-to-end Tests**: Test the entire application workflow.

For HTTP APIs:
- Write **Unit Tests** for API controllers.
- Write **Integration Tests** for database/API interaction.
- Write **End-to-End Tests** for complete workflows.



### What is Unit-testing? What are the FIRST principles?

**Unit testing** involves testing individual modules or components of software.

**FIRST principles**:
- **Fast**: Tests should be fast.
- **Independent**: Tests should not depend on others.
- **Repeatable**: Results should be consistent after every run.
- **Self-validating**: Tests should validate correctness automatically.
- **Timely**: Tests should be written before the code.



### REST API: What is it?

**REST (Representational State Transfer)** is an architectural style for building web services. REST APIs use HTTP methods and must be stateless.



### REST API: Name the main HTTP methods. What is the difference between Put and Patch?

Main HTTP methods:
- **GET**: Retrieve data.
- **POST**: Create data.
- **PUT**: Update data (replace entire resource).
- **PATCH**: Update data (modify specific parts of resource).
- **DELETE**: Delete data.



### Explain the MVC model.

**MVC (Model-View-Controller)** is a design pattern:
1. **Model**: Business logic and data.
2. **View**: UI representation.
3. **Controller**: Mediates between Model & View.



### Name the key principles of OOP?

The four key principles of **Object-Oriented Programming**:
1. **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods.
2. **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details.
3. **Inheritance**: Enables code reuse between classes.
4. **Polymorphism**: Enables methods to behave differently based on context.



### RDBMS: What is it?

**RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)** is software managing relational databases with structured data organized in tables.



### How data is stored in RDBMS?

Data is stored in **rows** inside relational tables. Tables have **columns** defining attributes. Each row represents an individual record.



### How tables can be joined?

Tables can be joined using SQL statements:
- **INNER JOIN**: Matches records with related data in both tables.
- **LEFT JOIN**: Includes all rows from the left table and matches from the right.
- **RIGHT JOIN**: Includes all rows from the right table and matches from the left.
- **FULL JOIN**: Combines left and right table rows.



### Explain Transactions and ACID.

**Transaction** refers to a sequence of operations treated as a single unit. **ACID** ensures reliability:
1. **Atomicity**: Operations are either completed or rolled back.
2. **Consistency**: Ensures database rules are maintained.
3. **Isolation**: Transactions don't affect each other.
4. **Durability**: Changes persist even after failure.



### What type of indexes do you know? When to use them?

**Types of indexes**:
1. **Primary Index**: Automatically created for primary keys.
2. **Unique Index**: Prevents duplicate values.
3. **Clustered Index**: Physical arrangement of data optimized for efficient retrieval.
4. **Non-clustered Index**: Logical order of data separated from physical storage.

Use indexes to improve query performance.



### How to change an already defined table structure with typeorm?

To change a table structure in **TypeORM**, use migration scripts:
1. Generate migration: `typeorm migration:generate`
2. Edit schema change commands.
3. Run migration: `typeorm migration:run`.



### What is MongoDB?

**MongoDB** is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, schema-less documents in BSON format. It is ideal for fast, scalable applications.



### How scaling of NoSQL and SQL databases differs?

- **NoSQL Scaling**: Horizontal scaling (adding more machines).
- **SQL Scaling**: Vertical scaling (increasing resources in existing machine).



### What is JWT? Is it safe to store sensitive information inside JWT?

**JWT (JSON Web Token)** is used for secure data transmission. It includes:
- **Header**: Metadata.
- **Payload**: Data.
- **Signature**: Ensures integrity.

Sensitive information **should not be stored** inside the JWT payload as it can be decoded.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are Pure Components?

**Pure Components** in React are components that only re-render when their props or state change. They automatically implement a shallow comparison of props and state to avoid unnecessary rendering. This behavior improves performance.



### When to use Node.js and when not to use it?

**When to use Node.js:**
- For building real-time applications (e.g., chat, online games).
- For I/O-intensive tasks (e.g., APIs, data streaming).
- When scalability is important.

**When not to use Node.js:**
- For CPU-intensive tasks, such as machine learning or heavy computations, as Node.js is single-threaded.
- Applications requiring complex relational operations (use RDBMS instead).



### What is npm?

**npm (Node Package Manager)** is the default package manager for Node.js. It is used to manage libraries, frameworks, and dependencies for Node.js projects. It enables developers to install, publish, and manage JavaScript packages.



### What is the difference between Sync vs Async operations?

- **Synchronous Operations**: Block the execution of code until the operation completes.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Do not block the execution. The operation continues in the background, allowing the program to proceed.



### When Streams can be used in Node.js?

**Streams** in Node.js are used for handling large-scale data sequentially. Use them:
- When reading/writing large files (e.g., `fs.createReadStream`).
- For HTTP requests and responses (e.g., API streaming data).
- When compressing/transforming data (e.g., `zlib.createGzip`).



### What is a Memory Leak? How to prevent it?

**Memory Leak** occurs when allocated memory is not released, causing application performance issues over time. 

**Prevention strategies:**
- Use proper scoping for variables.
- Clear timers and event listeners after use.
- Avoid global objects storing large data.



### What are the advantages of async/await over Promises?

**Advantages of async/await:**
- Simplified syntax: Code becomes more readable and sequential.
- Easier debugging: Errors can be caught using `try...catch`.
- Handles multiple asynchronous calls more cleanly compared to chained `.then()`.



### What is Express.js and what is its use?

**Express.js** is a lightweight and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It is used to build:
- RESTful APIs.
- Web servers capable of handling HTTP requests.



### What are the main building blocks of Express.js?

**Main building blocks:**
1. **Middleware**: Functions executed during request processing.
2. **Routing**: Defines application endpoint logic.
3. **Request Object**: Represents HTTP request.
4. **Response Object**: Sends HTTP responses.
5. **Error Handling**: Handles runtime exceptions.



### What is the use of `next()` in Express.js?

The **`next()` function** passes control to the next middleware function in the chain. It is crucial in middleware processing to ensure proper execution flow.



### What is a Given-When-Then pattern?

**Given-When-Then** is a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) pattern used for writing test cases:
- **Given**: Precondition/setup.
- **When**: Action under test.
- **Then**: Expected outcome.



### What are mocks and stubs? How are they used in integration testing?

- **Mocks**: Fake objects controlling the behavior of dependencies during a test.
- **Stubs**: Fixed responses for method calls.

They are used in integration testing to isolate components and simulate external interactions.



### REST API: What constraints does REST have?

**REST API constraints**:
1. **Statelessness**: Server does not maintain client state.
2. **Client-Server Separation**: Independent layers.
3. **Cacheability**: Responses must be cacheable where possible.
4. **Uniform Interface**: Consistent resource representation.



### REST API: What status should be sent in a response to a create object request?

The response should return **HTTP status 201 (Created)**, indicating the resource was successfully created.



### What is Dependency Injection?

**Dependency Injection** is a design pattern that provides the required dependencies to an object, rather than having the object instantiate them itself.



### What is a Layered Architecture? Give a few examples.

**Layered Architecture** organizes software into layers with specific roles. Examples:
- **Presentation Layer**: UI logic.
- **Business Logic Layer**: Core rules of the application.
- **Data Access Layer**: Interaction with the database.



### What is a normalization concept?

**Normalization** is the process of organizing relational database data to reduce redundancy and ensure data integrity. Common normal forms include:
- **1NF**: Removes duplications.
- **2NF**: Removes partial dependencies.
- **3NF**: Removes transitive dependencies.



### What table relationships do you know? How to create them?

**Types of Relationships:**
1. **One-to-One**: Use a foreign key in one table referencing another.
2. **One-to-Many**: A foreign key maps multiple records in one table to a single record in another.
3. **Many-to-Many**: Use an intermediate table to map records.



### What is the difference between DDL and DML?

- **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: Defines database structure (e.g., `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`).
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: Manipulates data (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).



### How data is organized in MongoDB?

Data in MongoDB is organized in:
- **Documents**: JSON-like BSON objects.
- **Collections**: Groups of documents.
- **Databases**: Groups of collections.



### What does the BASE stand for?

**BASE** is an architectural principle for NoSQL:
- **Basically Available**: System guarantees availability.
- **Soft State**: Client state may change over time.
- **Eventual Consistency**: Ensures data consistency eventually.



### How to make a relationship between Documents in MongoDB?

Relationships can be achieved via:
- **Embedding Documents**: Nest related data.
- **Referencing Documents**: Store foreign document ID.



### What is the difference among Encoding, Encryption, and Hashing?

- **Encoding**: Converts data into another format for transmission (e.g., Base64). 
- **Encryption**: Secures data using keys. Requires decryption using the same key (symmetric) or a paired key (asymmetric).
- **Hashing**: One-way transformation creating a fixed-length representation.



### What are the use cases for Encoding, Encryption, and Hashing?

- **Encoding**: Data transfer over non-compatible systems.
- **Encryption**: Securing sensitive data.
- **Hashing**: Password storage, data integrity verification.



### What is HTTPS? How it works?

**HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)** uses encryption (via SSL/TLS) to securely transmit data between the client and server. It uses public and private keys for secure communication.



### What is Authentication and Authorization?

- **Authentication**: Verifies user identity (e.g., username and password).
- **Authorization**: Grants permissions to users for accessing resources.



### Name the main advantages of Microservice architecture over Monolith.

Advantages of **Microservice Architecture**:
- Scalability: Independent scaling of services.
- Fault Isolation: Failure of one service doesn’t crash the system.
- Technology Diversity: Each service can use different technology.



### How do you understand an event-driven architecture? What is a pub-sub pattern?

**Event-Driven Architecture** reacts to events and is asynchronous. Applications use **publish-subscribe (pub/sub)** patterns, where publishers send messages to topics, and subscribers listen to specific events.

Below are the detailed answers for the **Good to Know Areas** section in Markdown format:



## Good to Know Areas

### What is the difference between dependencies and devDependencies in package.json?

- **dependencies**: Libraries required in production for the application to run. These packages are installed with the `npm install` command by default.
- **devDependencies**: Libraries only required during development (e.g., testing tools, linters). Installed using `npm install --only=dev`.

In the `package.json` file:
```json
"dependencies": {
  "express": "^4.18.2"
},
"devDependencies": {
  "jest": "^27.4.5"
}
```



### What is the Event Emitter class? How is it related to other classes?

- **`EventEmitter`** is a core class in Node.js that facilitates event-driven programming. It allows objects to emit and listen to events.
- Classes like `fs.ReadStream` and `http.Server` inherit from **EventEmitter**.

Example usage:
```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const emitter = new EventEmitter();

emitter.on('event', () => console.log('Event triggered!'));
emitter.emit('event'); // Outputs: Event triggered!
```



### What are the differences between worker thread and child_process?

- **Worker Threads**: Used for running JavaScript in multiple threads. Lightweight and shares the same memory.
- **Child Processes**: Create separate processes. Heavier as each child gets its own memory.

Use **worker threads** for parallel execution and **child processes** for isolated operations.



### What is the difference between CommonJS and ES modules?

- **CommonJS**:
  - Used in older Node.js versions.
  - Syntax: `require` for importing and `module.exports` for exporting.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    const moduleA = require('./moduleA');
    module.exports = { functionA };
    ```

- **ES Modules (ESM)**:
  - Native in modern JavaScript.
  - Syntax: `import` and `export`.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    import moduleA from './moduleA';
    export const functionA = () => {};
    ```



### How to force Node.js to treat your `.js` files as ES modules?

To force Node.js to treat `.js` files as ES modules, you can:
1. Add `"type": "module"` in your `package.json`.
2. Use `.mjs` extension for ES modules.

Example `package.json`:
```json
{
  "type": "module"
}
```



### What is Promisification and when is it used?

**Promisification** transforms a callback-based function into a Promise-based function. 

**Usage**: When working with libraries that only support callbacks, promisification makes it easier to interact using modern `Promise` or `async/await`.

Example:
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const util = require('util');

const readFileAsync = util.promisify(fs.readFile);

readFileAsync('./file.txt', 'utf-8').then(console.log).catch(console.error);
```



### How can you differentiate an error handling function from a request handler function?

In Express.js:
- An **error-handling middleware** has four arguments: `(err, req, res, next)` and is used specifically for catching and processing errors.
- A regular **request handler** has no `err` argument: `(req, res, next)`.

Example:
```javascript
// Request Handler
app.get('/endpoint', (req, res) => res.send('Request handled'));

// Error-Handling Middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});
```



### What can be a Provider in NestJS?

In **NestJS**, a **Provider** is a class, service, or factory that can be injected into other components. Providers are declared in the `@Module` decorator under the `providers` array. Examples: services, repositories, and custom utilities.



### What are the use cases for Pipes in NestJS?

**Pipes** in NestJS are used for:
1. **Validation**: Ensuring input data meets criteria (e.g., `ValidationPipe`).
2. **Transformation**: Converting input data into desired format.

Example:
```typescript
import { PipeTransform, Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class UppercasePipe implements PipeTransform {
  transform(value: string) {
    return value.toUpperCase();
  }
}
```



### Is there a possibility to bind extra logic before/after method execution in NestJS?

Yes, you can bind extra logic using **Interceptors** or **Guards**:
- **Interceptors**: Modify requests and responses (before/after execution).
- **Guards**: Add pre-execution logic, like authentication.



### How are all unhandled exceptions processed in NestJS?

**Unhandled exceptions** are captured by the built-in **Exception Filter** in NestJS. You can also create custom filters by extending the `ExceptionFilter<T>` interface to handle specific error scenarios.



### What is a Health Check? Why do we need it?

A **Health Check** helps monitor the operational status of a service (e.g., availability of DBs, APIs). It ensures the system is functioning and ready to handle requests.



### What is a correlation ID? How does it help debug your application?

A **Correlation ID** is a unique identifier for a request that flows through microservices. It helps trace and debug issues effectively by linking logs and metrics to a single user interaction.



### What test runner libraries do you know?

Popular test runner libraries:
- **Jest** (JavaScript/Node.js).
- **Mocha** & **Chai** (JavaScript/Node.js).
- **Jasmine**.
- **Cypress** (Frontend and end-to-end testing).



### REST API: What are the Levels of REST API?

The **Richardson Maturity Model** outlines the levels of REST API design:
1. **Level 0**: Single URI, single HTTP method.
2. **Level 1**: Resources (URIs represent objects).
3. **Level 2**: HTTP Methods (GET, POST, etc.).
4. **Level 3**: HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State).



### What is GraphQL? What are its advantages over REST API?

**GraphQL** is a query language for APIs that retrieves only the required data. 

**Advantages**:
- Flexible querying compared to REST’s fixed endpoints.
- Reduces over-fetching/under-fetching of data.
- Strongly typed schema for predictable queries.



### What data types are presented in PostgreSQL?

Common PostgreSQL data types:
1. **Numeric**: `INTEGER`, `BIGINT`, `DECIMAL`.
2. **String**: `TEXT`, `VARCHAR`.
3. **Date/Time**: `DATE`, `TIMESTAMP`.
4. **JSON**: `JSON`, `JSONB`.
5. **Geospatial**: `POINT`, `GEOMETRY`.



### What is a subquery?

A **subquery** is an SQL query nested inside another query. It's executed first, and its result is used by the outer query.

Example:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE id IN (SELECT employee_id FROM Salaries);
```



### What are Lock Levels in PostgreSQL?

**Lock Levels** define the level of restrictions on tables or rows:
1. **Row-Level Locks**: Blocks only specific rows (e.g., `SELECT FOR UPDATE`).
2. **Table-Level Locks**: Affects the entire table (e.g., `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock).



### What is ORM? What problems does it solve?

**ORM (Object Relational Mapping)** abstracts database operations using objects/models. It solves:
- Complexity in SQL queries.
- Cross-database compatibility.
- Redundant boilerplate code.

Example libraries: Sequelize, TypeORM.



### What is the Query Builder?

A **Query Builder** is a tool provided by ORMs to programmatically construct SQL queries using methods and objects, rather than writing raw SQL.



### What are Active Record and Data Mapper patterns?

- **Active Record Pattern**: Models have methods to persist themselves (used in Rails/ActiveRecord).
- **Data Mapper Pattern**: Separates business logic from persistence logic. Used in TypeORM.



### What is the difference between Raw Entities and Entities?

- **Raw Entities**: Result from a database query (unmapped data).
- **Entities**: Objects mapped using ORM models, containing logic and relationships.



### How to process tables with a lot of data inside with TypeORM?

Use techniques such as:
- Batch Processing: Divide execution into smaller chunks.
- Query Streams: Retrieve data incrementally.



### How do you understand symmetric and asymmetric encryption?

- **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses a single key for encryption and decryption (e.g., AES).
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Uses a key pair (public and private keys). The public key encrypts, and the private key decrypts (e.g., RSA).



### What is the difference between private and public key?

- **Public Key**: Shared publicly and used for encryption.
- **Private Key**: Kept secret and used for decryption.



### What types of Authentication do you know? When to use them?

**Authentication Types**:
1. **API Key**: For simple applications.
2. **Session-Based**: For web applications.
3. **Token-Based (e.g., JWT)**: For distributed systems.
4. **OAuth**: For third-party integrations.
5. **Biometric**: For high-security needs.



### What is a 3-tier WEB Application? Are the tiers logical or physical?

A **3-tier Web Application** includes:
1. **Presentation Layer**: Frontend (UI/UX).
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Backend (API/logic).
3. **Data Layer**: Database.

The tiers can be either **logical** or **physical**, depending on deployment.
