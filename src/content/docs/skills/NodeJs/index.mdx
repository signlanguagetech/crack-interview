Node.js is a fast, event-driven JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 engine, designed for building scalable server-side applications. Its non-blocking I/O model and vast npm ecosystem make it ideal for real-time applications, APIs, and microservices. Node.js powers many high-traffic websites and enterprise backends.

Sometimes, even with many years of experience in NodeJs, we encounter tricky questions that we can't answer expressively. To crack the interview, it's crucial to practice and write about these topics.

## Crucial Topics

### What is Node.js?

**Node.js** is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It allows developers to execute JavaScript on the server side. Node.js is built on the V8 engine, which is developed by Google, and uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it suitable for building scalable applications, especially for real-time systems.

### What is package.json?

**`package.json`** is the configuration file in a Node.js project. It contains metadata about the project such as its name, version, description, and scripts. It also includes information about the project's dependencies (`dependencies`) and development dependencies (`devDependencies`).



### How Event Loop works?

The **Event Loop** is the mechanism that makes Node.js non-blocking. Node.js executes tasks asynchronously using its event loop, and handles requests on a single-threaded architecture. The Event Loop processes tasks from different queues (timers, I/O callbacks, etc.), delegating heavy tasks to worker threads (via libuv) and executing JavaScript callbacks when the operation completes.



### Is Node.js entirely based on a single-thread?

No, while **Node.js** uses a single-threaded model for its event loop, it utilizes a thread pool internally via the `libuv` library to offload heavy tasks like file I/O, networking, or CPU-intensive computations.



### What kinds of streams does Node.js have?

**Node.js streams** are used for handling streaming data. The four types of streams are:

- **Readable Streams**: Used for reading data (e.g., `fs.createReadStream`).
- **Writable Streams**: Used for writing data (e.g., `fs.createWriteStream`).
- **Duplex Streams**: Used for both reading and writing (e.g., `net.Socket`).
- **Transform Streams**: Used for modifying or transforming data during streaming (e.g., `zlib.createGzip`).



### How do you understand the Callback Pattern? What is a callback hell?

The **Callback pattern** is a mechanism where a function is passed as an argument to another function and is called after a certain operation.

**Callback hell** refers to deeply nested callbacks that make code harder to read and debug. It can be avoided using modular coding, Promises, or async/await.



### What is a Promise?

**Promise** is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. With Promises, you can attach callbacks (`then`, `catch`) after an operation finishes.



### What states does the Promise have? Can the state be changed once it was fulfilled or rejected?

A **Promise** has the following states:

1. **Pending**: Initial state, operation not completed yet.
2. **Fulfilled**: Operation successfully completed.
3. **Rejected**: Operation failed.

Once a promise is fulfilled or rejected, its state cannot change further.



### What are the purposes for middlewares in Express.js?

**Express.js middlewares** are functions that process requests before sending a response. Purposes include:

- Handling authentication.
- Logging requests.
- Parsing request bodies (e.g., `body-parser`).
- Error handling.



### What is a test pyramid? How can you implement it regarding HTTP APIs?

A **Test Pyramid** is a testing strategy emphasizing different layers in tests:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components of the code.
- **Integration Tests**: Test components working together.
- **End-to-end Tests**: Test the entire application workflow.

For HTTP APIs:
- Write **Unit Tests** for API controllers.
- Write **Integration Tests** for database/API interaction.
- Write **End-to-End Tests** for complete workflows.



### What is Unit-testing? What are the FIRST principles?

**Unit testing** involves testing individual modules or components of software.

**FIRST principles**:
- **Fast**: Tests should be fast.
- **Independent**: Tests should not depend on others.
- **Repeatable**: Results should be consistent after every run.
- **Self-validating**: Tests should validate correctness automatically.
- **Timely**: Tests should be written before the code.



### REST API: What is it?

**REST (Representational State Transfer)** is an architectural style for building web services. REST APIs use HTTP methods and must be stateless.



### REST API: Name the main HTTP methods. What is the difference between Put and Patch?

Main HTTP methods:
- **GET**: Retrieve data.
- **POST**: Create data.
- **PUT**: Update data (replace entire resource).
- **PATCH**: Update data (modify specific parts of resource).
- **DELETE**: Delete data.



### Explain the MVC model.

**MVC (Model-View-Controller)** is a design pattern:
1. **Model**: Business logic and data.
2. **View**: UI representation.
3. **Controller**: Mediates between Model & View.



### Name the key principles of OOP?

The four key principles of **Object-Oriented Programming**:
1. **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods.
2. **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details.
3. **Inheritance**: Enables code reuse between classes.
4. **Polymorphism**: Enables methods to behave differently based on context.



### RDBMS: What is it?

**RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)** is software managing relational databases with structured data organized in tables.



### How data is stored in RDBMS?

Data is stored in **rows** inside relational tables. Tables have **columns** defining attributes. Each row represents an individual record.



### How tables can be joined?

Tables can be joined using SQL statements:
- **INNER JOIN**: Matches records with related data in both tables.
- **LEFT JOIN**: Includes all rows from the left table and matches from the right.
- **RIGHT JOIN**: Includes all rows from the right table and matches from the left.
- **FULL JOIN**: Combines left and right table rows.



### Explain Transactions and ACID.

**Transaction** refers to a sequence of operations treated as a single unit. **ACID** ensures reliability:
1. **Atomicity**: Operations are either completed or rolled back.
2. **Consistency**: Ensures database rules are maintained.
3. **Isolation**: Transactions don't affect each other.
4. **Durability**: Changes persist even after failure.



### What type of indexes do you know? When to use them?

**Types of indexes**:
1. **Primary Index**: Automatically created for primary keys.
2. **Unique Index**: Prevents duplicate values.
3. **Clustered Index**: Physical arrangement of data optimized for efficient retrieval.
4. **Non-clustered Index**: Logical order of data separated from physical storage.

Use indexes to improve query performance.



### How to change an already defined table structure with typeorm?

To change a table structure in **TypeORM**, use migration scripts:
1. Generate migration: `typeorm migration:generate`
2. Edit schema change commands.
3. Run migration: `typeorm migration:run`.



### What is MongoDB?

**MongoDB** is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, schema-less documents in BSON format. It is ideal for fast, scalable applications.



### How scaling of NoSQL and SQL databases differs?

- **NoSQL Scaling**: Horizontal scaling (adding more machines).
- **SQL Scaling**: Vertical scaling (increasing resources in existing machine).



### What is JWT? Is it safe to store sensitive information inside JWT?

**JWT (JSON Web Token)** is used for secure data transmission. It includes:
- **Header**: Metadata.
- **Payload**: Data.
- **Signature**: Ensures integrity.

Sensitive information **should not be stored** inside the JWT payload as it can be decoded.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are Pure Components?

**Pure Components** in React are components that only re-render when their props or state change. They automatically implement a shallow comparison of props and state to avoid unnecessary rendering. This behavior improves performance.



### When to use Node.js and when not to use it?

**When to use Node.js:**
- For building real-time applications (e.g., chat, online games).
- For I/O-intensive tasks (e.g., APIs, data streaming).
- When scalability is important.

**When not to use Node.js:**
- For CPU-intensive tasks, such as machine learning or heavy computations, as Node.js is single-threaded.
- Applications requiring complex relational operations (use RDBMS instead).



### What is npm?

**npm (Node Package Manager)** is the default package manager for Node.js. It is used to manage libraries, frameworks, and dependencies for Node.js projects. It enables developers to install, publish, and manage JavaScript packages.



### What is the difference between Sync vs Async operations?

- **Synchronous Operations**: Block the execution of code until the operation completes.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Do not block the execution. The operation continues in the background, allowing the program to proceed.



### When Streams can be used in Node.js?

**Streams** in Node.js are used for handling large-scale data sequentially. Use them:
- When reading/writing large files (e.g., `fs.createReadStream`).
- For HTTP requests and responses (e.g., API streaming data).
- When compressing/transforming data (e.g., `zlib.createGzip`).



### What is a Memory Leak? How to prevent it?

**Memory Leak** occurs when allocated memory is not released, causing application performance issues over time.

**Prevention strategies:**
- Use proper scoping for variables.
- Clear timers and event listeners after use.
- Avoid global objects storing large data.



### What are the advantages of async/await over Promises?

**Advantages of async/await:**
- Simplified syntax: Code becomes more readable and sequential.
- Easier debugging: Errors can be caught using `try...catch`.
- Handles multiple asynchronous calls more cleanly compared to chained `.then()`.



### What is Express.js and what is its use?

**Express.js** is a lightweight and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It is used to build:
- RESTful APIs.
- Web servers capable of handling HTTP requests.



### What are the main building blocks of Express.js?

**Main building blocks:**
1. **Middleware**: Functions executed during request processing.
2. **Routing**: Defines application endpoint logic.
3. **Request Object**: Represents HTTP request.
4. **Response Object**: Sends HTTP responses.
5. **Error Handling**: Handles runtime exceptions.



### What is the use of `next()` in Express.js?

The **`next()` function** passes control to the next middleware function in the chain. It is crucial in middleware processing to ensure proper execution flow.



### What is a Given-When-Then pattern?

**Given-When-Then** is a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) pattern used for writing test cases:
- **Given**: Precondition/setup.
- **When**: Action under test.
- **Then**: Expected outcome.



### What are mocks and stubs? How are they used in integration testing?

- **Mocks**: Fake objects controlling the behavior of dependencies during a test.
- **Stubs**: Fixed responses for method calls.

They are used in integration testing to isolate components and simulate external interactions.



### REST API: What constraints does REST have?

**REST API constraints**:
1. **Statelessness**: Server does not maintain client state.
2. **Client-Server Separation**: Independent layers.
3. **Cacheability**: Responses must be cacheable where possible.
4. **Uniform Interface**: Consistent resource representation.



### REST API: What status should be sent in a response to a create object request?

The response should return **HTTP status 201 (Created)**, indicating the resource was successfully created.



### What is Dependency Injection?

**Dependency Injection** is a design pattern that provides the required dependencies to an object, rather than having the object instantiate them itself.



### What is a Layered Architecture? Give a few examples.

**Layered Architecture** organizes software into layers with specific roles. Examples:
- **Presentation Layer**: UI logic.
- **Business Logic Layer**: Core rules of the application.
- **Data Access Layer**: Interaction with the database.



### What is a normalization concept?

**Normalization** is the process of organizing relational database data to reduce redundancy and ensure data integrity. Common normal forms include:
- **1NF**: Removes duplications.
- **2NF**: Removes partial dependencies.
- **3NF**: Removes transitive dependencies.



### What table relationships do you know? How to create them?

**Types of Relationships:**
1. **One-to-One**: Use a foreign key in one table referencing another.
2. **One-to-Many**: A foreign key maps multiple records in one table to a single record in another.
3. **Many-to-Many**: Use an intermediate table to map records.



### What is the difference between DDL and DML?

- **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: Defines database structure (e.g., `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`).
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: Manipulates data (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).



### How data is organized in MongoDB?

Data in MongoDB is organized in:
- **Documents**: JSON-like BSON objects.
- **Collections**: Groups of documents.
- **Databases**: Groups of collections.



### What does the BASE stand for?

**BASE** is an architectural principle for NoSQL:
- **Basically Available**: System guarantees availability.
- **Soft State**: Client state may change over time.
- **Eventual Consistency**: Ensures data consistency eventually.



### How to make a relationship between Documents in MongoDB?

Relationships can be achieved via:
- **Embedding Documents**: Nest related data.
- **Referencing Documents**: Store foreign document ID.



### What is the difference among Encoding, Encryption, and Hashing?

- **Encoding**: Converts data into another format for transmission (e.g., Base64).
- **Encryption**: Secures data using keys. Requires decryption using the same key (symmetric) or a paired key (asymmetric).
- **Hashing**: One-way transformation creating a fixed-length representation.



### What are the use cases for Encoding, Encryption, and Hashing?

- **Encoding**: Data transfer over non-compatible systems.
- **Encryption**: Securing sensitive data.
- **Hashing**: Password storage, data integrity verification.



### What is HTTPS? How it works?

**HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)** uses encryption (via SSL/TLS) to securely transmit data between the client and server. It uses public and private keys for secure communication.



### What is Authentication and Authorization?

- **Authentication**: Verifies user identity (e.g., username and password).
- **Authorization**: Grants permissions to users for accessing resources.



### Name the main advantages of Microservice architecture over Monolith.

Advantages of **Microservice Architecture**:
- Scalability: Independent scaling of services.
- Fault Isolation: Failure of one service doesn’t crash the system.
- Technology Diversity: Each service can use different technology.



### How do you understand an event-driven architecture? What is a pub-sub pattern?

**Event-Driven Architecture** reacts to events and is asynchronous. Applications use **publish-subscribe (pub/sub)** patterns, where publishers send messages to topics, and subscribers listen to specific events.

Below are the detailed answers for the **Good to Know Areas** section in Markdown format:



## Good to Know Areas

### What is the difference between dependencies and devDependencies in package.json?

- **dependencies**: Libraries required in production for the application to run. These packages are installed with the `npm install` command by default.
- **devDependencies**: Libraries only required during development (e.g., testing tools, linters). Installed using `npm install --only=dev`.

In the `package.json` file:
```json
"dependencies": {
  "express": "^4.18.2"
},
"devDependencies": {
  "jest": "^27.4.5"
}
```



### What is the Event Emitter class? How is it related to other classes?

- **`EventEmitter`** is a core class in Node.js that facilitates event-driven programming. It allows objects to emit and listen to events.
- Classes like `fs.ReadStream` and `http.Server` inherit from **EventEmitter**.

Example usage:
```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const emitter = new EventEmitter();

emitter.on('event', () => console.log('Event triggered!'));
emitter.emit('event'); // Outputs: Event triggered!
```



### What are the differences between worker thread and child_process?

- **Worker Threads**: Used for running JavaScript in multiple threads. Lightweight and shares the same memory.
- **Child Processes**: Create separate processes. Heavier as each child gets its own memory.

Use **worker threads** for parallel execution and **child processes** for isolated operations.



### What is the difference between CommonJS and ES modules?

- **CommonJS**:
  - Used in older Node.js versions.
  - Syntax: `require` for importing and `module.exports` for exporting.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    const moduleA = require('./moduleA');
    module.exports = { functionA };
    ```

- **ES Modules (ESM)**:
  - Native in modern JavaScript.
  - Syntax: `import` and `export`.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    import moduleA from './moduleA';
    export const functionA = () => {};
    ```



### How to force Node.js to treat your `.js` files as ES modules?

To force Node.js to treat `.js` files as ES modules, you can:
1. Add `"type": "module"` in your `package.json`.
2. Use `.mjs` extension for ES modules.

Example `package.json`:
```json
{
  "type": "module"
}
```



### What is Promisification and when is it used?

**Promisification** transforms a callback-based function into a Promise-based function.

**Usage**: When working with libraries that only support callbacks, promisification makes it easier to interact using modern `Promise` or `async/await`.

Example:
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const util = require('util');

const readFileAsync = util.promisify(fs.readFile);

readFileAsync('./file.txt', 'utf-8').then(console.log).catch(console.error);
```



### How can you differentiate an error handling function from a request handler function?

In Express.js:
- An **error-handling middleware** has four arguments: `(err, req, res, next)` and is used specifically for catching and processing errors.
- A regular **request handler** has no `err` argument: `(req, res, next)`.

Example:
```javascript
// Request Handler
app.get('/endpoint', (req, res) => res.send('Request handled'));

// Error-Handling Middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});
```



### What can be a Provider in NestJS?

In **NestJS**, a **Provider** is a class, service, or factory that can be injected into other components. Providers are declared in the `@Module` decorator under the `providers` array. Examples: services, repositories, and custom utilities.



### What are the use cases for Pipes in NestJS?

**Pipes** in NestJS are used for:
1. **Validation**: Ensuring input data meets criteria (e.g., `ValidationPipe`).
2. **Transformation**: Converting input data into desired format.

Example:
```typescript
import { PipeTransform, Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class UppercasePipe implements PipeTransform {
  transform(value: string) {
    return value.toUpperCase();
  }
}
```



### Is there a possibility to bind extra logic before/after method execution in NestJS?

Yes, you can bind extra logic using **Interceptors** or **Guards**:
- **Interceptors**: Modify requests and responses (before/after execution).
- **Guards**: Add pre-execution logic, like authentication.



### How are all unhandled exceptions processed in NestJS?

**Unhandled exceptions** are captured by the built-in **Exception Filter** in NestJS. You can also create custom filters by extending the `ExceptionFilter<T>` interface to handle specific error scenarios.



### What is a Health Check? Why do we need it?

A **Health Check** helps monitor the operational status of a service (e.g., availability of DBs, APIs). It ensures the system is functioning and ready to handle requests.



### What is a correlation ID? How does it help debug your application?

A **Correlation ID** is a unique identifier for a request that flows through microservices. It helps trace and debug issues effectively by linking logs and metrics to a single user interaction.



### What test runner libraries do you know?

Popular test runner libraries:
- **Jest** (JavaScript/Node.js).
- **Mocha** & **Chai** (JavaScript/Node.js).
- **Jasmine**.
- **Cypress** (Frontend and end-to-end testing).



### REST API: What are the Levels of REST API?

The **Richardson Maturity Model** outlines the levels of REST API design:
1. **Level 0**: Single URI, single HTTP method.
2. **Level 1**: Resources (URIs represent objects).
3. **Level 2**: HTTP Methods (GET, POST, etc.).
4. **Level 3**: HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State).



### What is GraphQL? What are its advantages over REST API?

**GraphQL** is a query language for APIs that retrieves only the required data.

**Advantages**:
- Flexible querying compared to REST’s fixed endpoints.
- Reduces over-fetching/under-fetching of data.
- Strongly typed schema for predictable queries.



### What data types are presented in PostgreSQL?

Common PostgreSQL data types:
1. **Numeric**: `INTEGER`, `BIGINT`, `DECIMAL`.
2. **String**: `TEXT`, `VARCHAR`.
3. **Date/Time**: `DATE`, `TIMESTAMP`.
4. **JSON**: `JSON`, `JSONB`.
5. **Geospatial**: `POINT`, `GEOMETRY`.



### What is a subquery?

A **subquery** is an SQL query nested inside another query. It's executed first, and its result is used by the outer query.

Example:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE id IN (SELECT employee_id FROM Salaries);
```



### What are Lock Levels in PostgreSQL?

**Lock Levels** define the level of restrictions on tables or rows:
1. **Row-Level Locks**: Blocks only specific rows (e.g., `SELECT FOR UPDATE`).
2. **Table-Level Locks**: Affects the entire table (e.g., `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock).



### What is ORM? What problems does it solve?

**ORM (Object Relational Mapping)** abstracts database operations using objects/models. It solves:
- Complexity in SQL queries.
- Cross-database compatibility.
- Redundant boilerplate code.

Example libraries: Sequelize, TypeORM.



### What is the Query Builder?

A **Query Builder** is a tool provided by ORMs to programmatically construct SQL queries using methods and objects, rather than writing raw SQL.



### What are Active Record and Data Mapper patterns?

- **Active Record Pattern**: Models have methods to persist themselves (used in Rails/ActiveRecord).
- **Data Mapper Pattern**: Separates business logic from persistence logic. Used in TypeORM.



### What is the difference between Raw Entities and Entities?

- **Raw Entities**: Result from a database query (unmapped data).
- **Entities**: Objects mapped using ORM models, containing logic and relationships.



### How to process tables with a lot of data inside with TypeORM?

Use techniques such as:
- Batch Processing: Divide execution into smaller chunks.
- Query Streams: Retrieve data incrementally.



### How do you understand symmetric and asymmetric encryption?

- **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses a single key for encryption and decryption (e.g., AES).
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Uses a key pair (public and private keys). The public key encrypts, and the private key decrypts (e.g., RSA).



### What is the difference between private and public key?

- **Public Key**: Shared publicly and used for encryption.
- **Private Key**: Kept secret and used for decryption.



### What types of Authentication do you know? When to use them?

**Authentication Types**:
1. **API Key**: For simple applications.
2. **Session-Based**: For web applications.
3. **Token-Based (e.g., JWT)**: For distributed systems.
4. **OAuth**: For third-party integrations.
5. **Biometric**: For high-security needs.



### What is a 3-tier WEB Application? Are the tiers logical or physical?

A **3-tier Web Application** includes:
1. **Presentation Layer**: Frontend (UI/UX).
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Backend (API/logic).
3. **Data Layer**: Database.

The tiers can be either **logical** or **physical**, depending on deployment.
