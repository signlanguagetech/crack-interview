## Crucial Topics

### What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It adds optional static types, classes, and interfaces to JavaScript.

### Why do we need TypeScript? What are the differences between TypeScript and JavaScript?
TypeScript provides static typing, which helps catch errors at compile time rather than runtime. It also supports modern JavaScript features and provides better tooling with IntelliSense and code navigation.

### Pros and cons of using TS.
Pros:
- Static typing
- Enhanced IDE support
- Early error detection
- Improved code readability and maintainability

Cons:
- Additional compilation step
- Learning curve for developers new to static typing
- Potentially longer development time due to type annotations

### How to transform TS code into JS?
Use the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) to compile TypeScript code into JavaScript. The `tsconfig.json` file can be used to configure the compilation options.

### What is void, and when to use the void type?
The `void` type represents the absence of a value. It is commonly used as the return type of functions that do not return a value.

### Explain how enums work in TypeScript?
Enums allow you to define a set of named constants. They can be numeric or string-based.

### What is an interface?
An interface defines the shape of an object, specifying the types of its properties. It is used for type-checking and ensuring that objects conform to a specific structure.

### Explain the various ways to control member visibility in TypeScript.
TypeScript provides three access modifiers: `public`, `private`, and `protected`. `public` members are accessible from anywhere, `private` members are accessible only within the class, and `protected` members are accessible within the class and its subclasses.

### What are Generics in TypeScript?
Generics allow you to create reusable components that work with any data type. They provide a way to create functions, classes, and interfaces that can operate on different types while maintaining type safety.

### What is the difference between extends and implements in TypeScript?
`extends` is used to create a subclass that inherits properties and methods from a parent class. `implements` is used to ensure that a class adheres to a specific interface by implementing its properties and methods.

### List some of the utility types provided by TypeScript and explain their usage.
- `Partial<T>`: Makes all properties of `T` optional.
- `Required<T>`: Makes all properties of `T` required.
- `Readonly<T>`: Makes all properties of `T` read-only.
- `Pick<T, K>`: Creates a type by picking a set of properties `K` from `T`.
- `Omit<T, K>`: Creates a type by omitting a set of properties `K` from `T`.

### What are type assertions in TypeScript?
Type assertions allow you to override the inferred type of a value. They are used when you know more about the type of a value than TypeScript does.

### When should you use the unknown type?
The `unknown` type is used when you do not know the type of a value. It is safer than `any` because it requires type checking before performing operations on the value.

### What is the difference between types String in JavaScript and string in TypeScript?
`String` in JavaScript is a constructor function for creating string objects, while `string` in TypeScript is a primitive type representing string values.

### What are string literal types?
String literal types allow you to specify a set of possible string values for a variable. They are useful for creating more precise types.

### What are abstract classes? When should you use one?
Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated directly. They are used as base classes for other classes and can contain abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses.

### Explain the tuple types in TypeScript.
Tuples are fixed-length arrays with specific types for each element. They allow you to represent a collection of values with different types.

### Explain how tuple destructuring works in TypeScript.
Tuple destructuring allows you to extract values from a tuple and assign them to variables. It provides a concise way to work with tuple elements.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Mention some of the features of TypeScript.
- Static typing
- Classes and interfaces
- Modules and namespaces
- Generics
- Type inference
- Decorators
- Union and intersection types

### Explain the Components of Typescript.
- TypeScript Compiler (`tsc`): Transforms TypeScript code into JavaScript.
- TypeScript Language Service: Provides features like IntelliSense, code navigation, and refactoring.
- TypeScript Language: The syntax and semantics of TypeScript.

### Explain the purpose of the never type in TypeScript.
The `never` type represents values that never occur. It is used for functions that never return, such as functions that throw exceptions or have infinite loops.

### What are union types in TypeScript?
Union types allow a variable to hold values of multiple types. They are defined using the `|` operator.

### How to make object properties immutable in TypeScript?
Use the `Readonly<T>` utility type to make all properties of an object read-only.

### How to easily make all properties of an interface optional?
Use the `Partial<T>` utility type to make all properties of an interface optional.

### What is the difference between keyof and typeof operators? Explain each of them.
- `keyof`: Takes an object type and produces a string or numeric literal union of its keys.
- `typeof`: Returns the type of a value or variable.

### What is the difference between type and interface in TypeScript?
- `type`: Used to define type aliases, unions, intersections, and mapped types.
- `interface`: Used to define the shape of an object and can be extended or implemented by classes.

### What is tsconfig.json file?
`tsconfig.json` is a configuration file for the TypeScript compiler. It specifies the root files and compiler options required to compile a TypeScript project.

### What is the fundamental difference between Optional Chaining (?.) and Non-null assertion operator (!) in TypeScript?
- Optional Chaining (`?.`): Safely accesses nested properties, returning `undefined` if any part of the chain is `null` or `undefined`.
- Non-null assertion operator (`!`): Asserts that a value is not `null` or `undefined`.

### What is the difference between void and never types?
- `void`: Represents the absence of a value, typically used as a return type for functions that do not return a value.
- `never`: Represents values that never occur, used for functions that never return.

### What are conditional types? How do you create them?
Conditional types allow you to create types based on a condition. They use the syntax `T extends U ? X : Y`.

### Does TypeScript support function overloading?
Yes, TypeScript supports function overloading. You can define multiple signatures for a function, and TypeScript will resolve the correct signature based on the arguments passed.

### Explain Decorators in TypeScript.
Decorators are special functions that can be applied to classes, methods, properties, and parameters to modify their behavior. They are used for metadata annotations and aspect-oriented programming.

### How to use Indexed Access Types?
Indexed access types allow you to access the type of a property of an object type. They use the syntax `T[K]`, where `T` is the object type and `K` is the key.

### Can Type aliases be recursive?
Yes, type aliases can be recursive. You can define a type alias that references itself.

### What is Namespace and how to declare it?
Namespaces are used to organize code into logical groups and prevent name collisions. They are declared using the `namespace` keyword.

### What is TypeScript Declare Keyword?
The `declare` keyword is used to declare variables, functions, classes, and interfaces that exist in the global scope or are provided by external libraries. It is used to provide type information without defining the actual implementation.

### What is 'satisfies' in TypeScript and compared to 'as'?
"satisfies" that validates your value against a type without changing the type inference, ensuring your implementation meets a contract while preserving specific type information.

"as" is a type assertion that forces TypeScript to treat a value as a specific type, potentially bypassing type checking.

Key difference: "satisfies" verifies compatibility while preserving the original inferred type's precision, whereas "as" overwrites the type inference and can lead to unsafe code if used incorrectly.
