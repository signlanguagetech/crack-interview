## Crucial Topics

### What is the difference between component and directive?
Components are a type of directive with a template. Directives are used to add behavior to an existing DOM element.

### What are types of directives?
There are three types of directives in Angular:
1. Component Directives
2. Structural Directives
3. Attribute Directives

### What are pipes?
Pipes are used to transform data in templates. They take in data as input and transform it to a desired output.

### One way vs two way bindings
One-way binding binds data from the component to the view or vice versa. Two-way binding allows data to flow in both directions.

### What are component lifecycle
The component lifecycle includes the stages a component goes through from creation to destruction.

### What are lifecycle hooks?
Lifecycle hooks are methods that Angular calls at different stages of a component's lifecycle.

### What types of forms presented in Angular?
Angular provides two types of forms: Template-driven forms and Reactive forms.

### What is the difference between Reactive and Template driven forms?
Template-driven forms are easy to use but less scalable, while Reactive forms are more powerful and scalable.

### What is Control Value Accessor?
Control Value Accessor is an interface that acts as a bridge between Angular forms API and the native element.

### Input and Output decorators
Input decorator is used to pass data from parent to child component. Output decorator is used to pass data from child to parent component.

### How Angular understands what dependency to use?
Angular uses Dependency Injection (DI) to determine and provide the required dependencies.

### Elements Tree vs Module Tree?
Elements Tree represents the DOM structure, while Module Tree represents the Angular module structure.

### What is the difference between ViewChild/children and ContentChild/children
ViewChild/children queries the view DOM, while ContentChild/children queries the projected content DOM.

### View Tree in Angular?
The View Tree represents the hierarchy of views in an Angular application.

### CD Strategies?
Change Detection (CD) strategies determine how and when Angular checks for changes in the component.

### How to create custom strategy?
Custom strategies can be created by implementing the `ChangeDetectionStrategy` interface.

### How to trigger cd manually?
Change detection can be triggered manually using `ChangeDetectorRef`.

### Difference between markForCheck, detectChanges, tick?
`markForCheck` marks the component for checking, `detectChanges` triggers change detection, and `tick` runs change detection for the entire application.

### Detach vs Reattach?
`detach` stops change detection for a component, while `reattach` resumes it.

### What actions triggers change detection?
Change detection can be triggered by events, HTTP requests, timers, and user interactions.

### What events are triggering CD with OnPush strategy?
With OnPush strategy, change detection is triggered by input property changes and events.

### What is the difference between Observable and Promise?
Observables are lazy and can handle multiple values over time, while Promises are eager and handle a single value.

### Different types of Subjects?
There are four types of Subjects: Subject, BehaviorSubject, ReplaySubject, and AsyncSubject.

### Difference between Observable and Subject?
Observables are unicast, while Subjects are multicast.

### BehaviorSubject vs AsyncSubject vs ReplaySubject vs Subject?
- `Subject`: No initial value, emits to current subscribers.
- `BehaviorSubject`: Requires an initial value, emits the latest value to new subscribers.
- `ReplaySubject`: Emits specified number of last values to new subscribers.
- `AsyncSubject`: Emits the last value to subscribers upon completion.

### What are hot, cold and warm streams?
- `Hot streams`: Emit values regardless of subscribers.
- `Cold streams`: Emit values only when subscribed.
- `Warm streams`: Emit values to current subscribers and cache the latest value for new subscribers.

### How to unsubscribe?
Unsubscribe by calling the `unsubscribe` method on the subscription.

### Different unsubscribe approaches, should know pros and cons of each.
- Manual unsubscribe
- `takeUntil` operator
- `AsyncPipe`
- `Subscription` management

### What are http interceptors?
HTTP interceptors are used to intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses.

### What is the purpose of routing in SPA?
Routing in SPA allows navigation between different views without reloading the page.

### How SPA navigation different from MPA navigation?
SPA navigation updates the view without reloading the page, while MPA navigation reloads the entire page.

### How to create a route?
Define routes in the `RouterModule` and use the `RouterLink` directive for navigation.

### What is the purpose of 'pathMatch: full' property?
`pathMatch: full` ensures that the entire URL path matches the route.

### How to pass data through router?
Pass data using route parameters, query parameters, or state.

### Name all guards?
- `CanActivate`
- `CanActivateChild`
- `CanDeactivate`
- `Resolve`
- `CanLoad`

### What are the purpose of each guard?
- `CanActivate`: Checks if a route can be activated.
- `CanActivateChild`: Checks if child routes can be activated.
- `CanDeactivate`: Checks if a route can be deactivated.
- `Resolve`: Pre-fetches data before activating a route.
- `CanLoad`: Checks if a module can be loaded.

### What is Lazy loading?
Lazy loading loads modules only when they are needed.

### How to implement lazy loading?
Use the `loadChildren` property in the route configuration.

### What are chunks?
Chunks are smaller bundles of code that are loaded on demand.

### Optimization techniques within Angular?
- Lazy loading
- Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation
- Tree shaking
- Code splitting

### What is trackBy?
`trackBy` is used to improve performance by tracking items in a list by a unique identifier.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How to create a custom directive?
Create a custom directive by implementing the `Directive` decorator and defining the directive's behavior.

### What is the difference between pure and impure pipes?
Pure pipes are stateless and only depend on input arguments. Impure pipes can have side effects and depend on external state.

### What are the subsequence of lifecycle hooks?
- `ngOnChanges`
- `ngOnInit`
- `ngDoCheck`
- `ngAfterContentInit`
- `ngAfterContentChecked`
- `ngAfterViewInit`
- `ngAfterViewChecked`
- `ngOnDestroy`

### What is each hook are commonly used for?
- `ngOnChanges`: Respond to input changes.
- `ngOnInit`: Initialize the component.
- `ngDoCheck`: Detect and act upon changes.
- `ngAfterContentInit`: Respond after content projection.
