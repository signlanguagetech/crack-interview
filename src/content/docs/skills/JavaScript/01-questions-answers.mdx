  JavaScript Questions and Answers.
  JavaScript is an interpreted, high-level programming language primarily used for web development.
  Its execution engine depends on the platform: browsers use engines like V8 (Chrome), SpiderMonkey (Firefox), or JavaScriptCore (Safari), while Node.js uses the V8 engine for server-side JavaScript execution.

## Crucial Topics

### What are data types in JavaScript?
JavaScript has the following data types:
- **Primitive Types**: `string`, `number`, `bigint`, `boolean`, `undefined`, `symbol`, `null`
- **Non-Primitive Types**: Objects (including arrays, functions, custom objects)
  
Examples:
```javascript
let str = "Hello";       // String
let num = 42;            // Number
let bool = true;         // Boolean
let bigInt = 123n;       // BigInt
let undef;               // Undefined
let sym = Symbol("foo"); // Symbol
let obj = { key: "value" }; // Object
```

---

### What are primitive data types?
Primitive data types represent immutable values and are directly accessed:
- `string`
- `number`
- `bigint`
- `boolean`
- `null`
- `undefined`
- `symbol`

---

### Difference between primitives vs objects?
| **Primitives**                     | **Objects**                                   |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Immutable (cannot change value)   | Mutable (properties can be updated/changed)  |
| Stored directly in memory         | Stored as references                         |
| Accessed by value                 | Accessed by reference                        |

Example:
```javascript
let x = 5; // Primitive
let obj = { key: "value" }; // Object
```

---

### What is coercion in JavaScript?
Coercion refers to converting one data type into another:
- **Implicit coercion**: JavaScript automatically converts types.
- **Explicit coercion**: You manually convert data types.

Example:
```javascript
console.log("5" + 2);       // Implicit -> "52"
console.log(Number("5") + 2); // Explicit -> 7
```

---

### Do you know what Autoboxing in JS is?
Autoboxing is the automatic conversion of primitive types to their object equivalents so you can call methods on primitives like `string` or `number`.

Example:
```javascript
let str = "Hello";
str.toUpperCase(); // Implicitly converted to String object
```

---

### What is the difference between `==` and `===` operators?
| **`==`**                                | **`===`**                          |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Checks for equality after type coercion | Checks for equality without type coercion |
| May cause unintended comparison results | Strict comparison (preferred)       |

Example:
```javascript
console.log(5 == "5");  // true (type coercion)
console.log(5 === "5"); // false (no coercion)
```

---

### What is undefined data type?
`undefined` is a primitive value assigned to variables when they are declared but not initialized.

Example:
```javascript
let foo;
console.log(foo); // undefined
```

---

### What is null value?
`null` is a special value representing "empty" or "nonexistent".

Example:
```javascript
let foo = null;
console.log(foo); // null
```

---

### What does `isNaN` function do?
Checks if a value is `NaN` (Not-a-Number). Returns `true` for values that can't be converted to a number.

Example:
```javascript
console.log(isNaN("abc")); // true
console.log(isNaN(123));   // false
```

---

### What does NaN value mean?
`NaN` stands for "Not-a-Number". It occurs when an operation results in a number that doesn't have a valid representation.

Example:
```javascript
console.log(0 / 0); // NaN
```

---

### What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?
| **`null`**                 | **`undefined`**                      |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Represents intentional absence of value | Variable declared but not assigned |
| Type: `object`            | Type: `undefined`                    |

---

### How do you copy properties from one object to other?
Use `Object.assign()` or the spread operator:
```javascript
let obj1 = { a: 1 };
let obj2 = { b: 2 };

Object.assign(obj2, obj1);
console.log(obj2); // { b: 2, a: 1 }

// Using Spread
let obj3 = { ...obj1, ...obj2 };
console.log(obj3); // { a: 1, b: 2 }
```

---

### What are classes in ES6?
Classes are syntactic sugar for creating objects and working with prototypes.

Example:
```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}`);
  }
}
let person = new Person("John");
person.greet(); // Hello, John
```

---

### Explain how prototypal inheritance works?
Objects can have a prototype which is another object. This prototype acts as a fallback for properties/methods.

Example:
```javascript
let parent = { greet() { console.log("Hello"); } };
let child = Object.create(parent);
child.greet(); // Inherits from parent
```

---

### How do you assign default values to variables?
Using the `||` operator or default parameter syntax.
```javascript
function greet(name = "Guest") {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
}
greet(); // Hello, Guest
```

---

### What is the difference between `let`, `const` and `var`?

| **`var`**                              | **`let`**                        | **`const`**                |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Function-scoped                      | Block-scoped                    | Block-scoped               |
| Can be redeclared                    | Cannot be redeclared            | Cannot be reassigned       |
| Hoisted                              | Hoisted                         | Hoisted, but no initialization |

---

### What are the differences between undeclared and undefined variables?
| **Undeclared**         | **Undefined**                          |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Not defined in code   | Defined, but no value assigned         |
| Causes reference error | Does not cause an error               |

---

### What are global variables?
Variables declared outside any function or block are accessible everywhere in your code.

Example:
```javascript
let globalVar = "I am global";
```

---

### What is Hoisting?
Hoisting is JavaScript's behavior where functions and variable declarations are moved to the top of their scope.

Example:
```javascript
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 5;
```

---

### What is scope in JavaScript?
Scope refers to the accessibility of variables/functions in different parts of the code. Types: `global` and `local`

---

### What is closure in JavaScript?
Closure occurs when a function retains access to its enclosing scope, even after the outer function has returned.

Example:
```javascript
function outer() {
  let secret = "secret";
  return function inner() {
    console.log(secret);
  };
}
const fn = outer();
fn(); // secret
```

---

### How does closure implemented in JavaScript?
Closures are automatically created when a nested function retains access to variables from its parent scope.

---

### What is the difference between Call, Apply and Bind?
- `call`: Calls a function, passing arguments one-by-one.
- `apply`: Calls a function, passing arguments as an array.
- `bind`: Creates a new function bound to a specific `this`.

```javascript
function greet(age) {
  console.log(`${this.name} is ${age}`);
}
const obj = { name: "John" };
greet.call(obj, 25); // John is 25
greet.apply(obj, [25]); // John is 25
const bound = greet.bind(obj);
bound(25); // John is 25
```

---

### What does 'this loses context' mean?
When `this` behavior gets modified or lost due to improper invocation, it doesn't refer to the expected object.

---

### What is JSON and its common operations?
- **JSON**: JavaScript Object Notation, a text format for data exchange.
- **Operations**:
  - `JSON.stringify()` → Convert object to JSON string
  - `JSON.parse()` → Convert JSON string to an object

Below are the answers to your questions written in Markdown format.

---

### How do you parse JSON string?
You use `JSON.parse()` to convert a JSON string into a JavaScript object.

Example:
```javascript
const jsonString = '{"name": "John", "age": 30}';
const obj = JSON.parse(jsonString);
console.log(obj.name); // John
```

---

### What is the purpose of JSON stringify?
`JSON.stringify()` is used to convert a JavaScript object into a JSON string.

Example:
```javascript
const obj = { name: "John", age: 30 };
const jsonString = JSON.stringify(obj);
console.log(jsonString); // {"name":"John","age":30}
```

---

### What array methods do you know?
Common array methods:
- `push()`
- `pop()`
- `shift()`
- `unshift()`
- `map()`
- `filter()`
- `reduce()`
- `forEach()`
- `find()`
- `indexOf()`
- `includes()`
- `slice()`
- `splice()`
- `sort()`
- `reverse()`

---

### What is the difference between Array.forEach() and Array.map()?
| **forEach**                     | **map**                           |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Iterates over elements         | Iterates and returns a new array |
| Used for side effects           | Used for transformations         |
| Doesn't return anything         | Returns a new array             |

Example:
```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.forEach((num) => console.log(num * 2)); // Side effect
const mappedArr = arr.map((num) => num * 2); // [2, 4, 6]
```

---

### What are the lambda or arrow functions?
Arrow functions are shorthand syntax for writing function expressions. They use `=>` and don't have their own `this`.

Example:
```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5
```

---

### What is a pure function?
A pure function is:
1. Deterministic: Same input always yields the same output.
2. Side-effect-free: Does not change external states.

Example:
```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

---

### What is IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)?
An IIFE is a function that executes immediately after it's declared.

Example:
```javascript
(function () {
  console.log("IIFE executed!");
})();
```

---

### What is a callback function?
A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function and executed later.

Example:
```javascript
function greet(name, callback) {
  callback(name);
}
greet("John", (name) => console.log(`Hello, ${name}`)); // Hello, John
```

---

### What is a promise?
A promise represents an asynchronous operation and its eventual result. It has three states:
- **Pending**
- **Fulfilled**
- **Rejected**

Example:
```javascript
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve("Success");
});
```

---

### Why do we need a promise?
Promises simplify handling asynchronous operations by avoiding callback hell and providing cleaner code.

---

### List all states of a promise?
1. **Pending**: Initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
2. **Fulfilled**: Operation completed successfully.
3. **Rejected**: Operation failed.

---

### Why do we need callbacks?
Callbacks are required to handle asynchronous operations like reading files, making network requests, or reacting to user events.

---

### What is a callback hell?
Callback hell occurs when multiple nested callbacks make code difficult to understand and maintain.

Example:
```javascript
step1(() => {
  step2(() => {
    step3(() => {
      // Hard to read and maintain
    });
  });
});
```

---

### What is promise chaining?
Promise chaining involves chaining `.then()` blocks to handle multiple asynchronous operations sequentially.

Example:
```javascript
fetchData()
  .then((data) => processData(data))
  .then((result) => displayResult(result))
  .catch((error) => console.error(error));
```

---

### What is the purpose of using setTimeout?
`setTimeout` delays the execution of a function by a specified duration.

Example:
```javascript
setTimeout(() => console.log("Hello after 1 second"), 1000);
```

---

### What is the purpose of using setInterval?
`setInterval` repeatedly calls a function at specified intervals until cleared.

Example:
```javascript
setInterval(() => console.log("Repeating every second"), 1000);
```

---

### What is an event loop?
The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations, ensuring non-blocking execution.

---

### What is a call stack?
The call stack is a data structure used by JavaScript to track execution contexts.

Example:
```javascript
function first() {
  second();
}
function second() {
  console.log("Second function");
}
first();
// Execution order tracked in the call stack
```

---

### How do you validate an email in JavaScript?
Use a regular expression to validate an email format.

Example:
```javascript
function validateEmail(email) {
  const regex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  return regex.test(email);
}
console.log(validateEmail("test@example.com")); // true
```

---

### What are modules?
Modules are reusable pieces of code that can be imported/exported between files.

Example:
```javascript
// module.js
export const greet = () => console.log("Hello");

// main.js
import { greet } from './module.js';
greet(); // Hello
```

---

### Why do you need modules?
Modules improve code organization, reusability, and maintainability by breaking up large files into smaller components.

---

### What is a rest operator?
The rest operator (`...`) collects multiple elements into an array.

Example:
```javascript
function sum(...numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b);
}
console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4)); // 10
```

---

### What is a spread operator?
The spread operator (`...`) expands arrays/objects into individual elements.

Example:
```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
console.log([...arr, 4]); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

---

### What is Node.js?
**Node.js** is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript outside of the browser, often used for server-side development.

---

### What is the difference between `window` and `document`?
| **`window`**                            | **`document`**                        |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Represents the browser window          | Represents the HTML document          |
| Global object with properties like `alert`, `location`, etc. | Access HTML elements via DOM           |

Example:
```javascript
console.log(window.location); // URL info
console.log(document.title);  // Title of the web page
``` 

## Frequently asked questions

### Explain what a Symbol is in JavaScript?

A **`Symbol`** is a unique and immutable primitive data type in JavaScript, introduced in ES6. It is typically used as a unique identifier for object properties.

Features:
- Each `Symbol` is unique, even if two symbols have the same description.
- Symbols are not enumerable in `for...in` loops.

Example:
```javascript
const sym1 = Symbol("id");
const sym2 = Symbol("id");

console.log(sym1 === sym2); // false

const user = {
  [sym1]: "12345",
};
console.log(user[sym1]); // 12345
```

---

### How do you check whether a string contains a substring?

Use the `String.prototype.includes()` method to check if a string contains a substring.

Example:
```javascript
const str = "Hello, world!";
console.log(str.includes("world")); // true
console.log(str.includes("javascript")); // false
```

Other methods:
- `String.prototype.indexOf()` (returns -1 if not found):
```javascript
console.log(str.indexOf("world") !== -1); // true
```
- RegExp with `.test()`:
```javascript
console.log(/world/.test(str)); // true
```

---

### How do you check if a key exists in an object?

You can check if a key exists in an object using:
1. The `in` operator:
```javascript
const obj = { key: "value" };
console.log("key" in obj); // true
console.log("otherKey" in obj); // false
```

2. The `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty()` method:
```javascript
console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty("key")); // true
console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty("otherKey")); // false
```

---

### What is the main difference between `Object.values` and `Object.entries` method?

- **`Object.values()`**: Returns an array of the values of an object's properties.
- **`Object.entries()`**: Returns an array of key-value pairs (2-item arrays) of an object's properties.

Example:
```javascript
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };

console.log(Object.values(obj)); // [1, 2, 3]
console.log(Object.entries(obj)); // [["a", 1], ["b", 2], ["c", 3]]
```

---

### How can you get the list of keys of any object?

Use `Object.keys()` to get an array of an object's keys.

Example:
```javascript
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
console.log(Object.keys(obj)); // ["a", "b", "c"]
```

---

### What is a WeakSet?

A **`WeakSet`** is a collection of objects where:
1. Only objects can be added (primitive values are not allowed).
2. Objects are held weakly, meaning they can be garbage-collected if there are no other references to them.
3. It doesn't have methods to iterate over its elements (`forEach`, `size`, etc.).

Example:
```javascript
let obj = { name: "John" };
const weakset = new WeakSet();
weakset.add(obj);
console.log(weakset.has(obj)); // true

obj = null; // The object is now eligible for garbage collection
```

---

### What are the differences between WeakSet and Set?

| **`Set`**                    | **`WeakSet`**                              |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Stores any type of data (objects and primitives). | Only stores objects.                     |
| Iterable with methods like `forEach()`, `size`. | Not iterable and does not have `.size`. |
| Strongly holds references to items.            | Weakly holds references, eligible for garbage collection. |
| Example: `new Set([1, 2, 3])`.                | Example: `new WeakSet()` (objects only). |

---

### What is a WeakMap?

A **`WeakMap`** is a collection of key-value pairs where:
1. Keys must be objects, not primitives.
2. Keys are weakly held (can be garbage-collected when no longer referenced).

Example:
```javascript
let obj = { name: "John" };
const weakmap = new WeakMap();

weakmap.set(obj, "Details");
console.log(weakmap.get(obj)); // "Details"

obj = null; // Key is garbage collected
```

---

### What are the differences between WeakMap and Map?

| **`Map`**                    | **`WeakMap`**                             |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Keys can be any type (objects or primitives). | Keys must be objects.                  |
| Iterable with `forEach()`, `size`.           | Not iterable and has no `.size`.       |
| Strongly holds key-value pairs.             | Weakly holds keys, eligible for garbage collection. |
| Example: `new Map([[1, "a"], [2, "b"]])`.   | Example: `new WeakMap()` (objects as keys). |

---

### What is the difference between `__proto__` and `prototype`?

- **`__proto__`**: Refers to the prototype of a specific object.
- **`prototype`**: Refers to the prototype property of a function, used for inheritance.

Example:
```javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
const john = new Person("John");

console.log(john.__proto__ === Person.prototype); // true
console.log(typeof Person.prototype); // object
```

---

### What are the problems with global variables?

1. **Namespace pollution**: If multiple scripts use the same global variable name, they can overwrite each other.
2. **Difficulty in debugging**: Changes to global variables are hard to track.
3. **Increased coupling**: Code relying on globals is harder to reuse.
4. **Memory leaks**: Global variables persist for the lifetime of the program.

---

### What is the Funarg problem?

The **Funarg (Function Argument)** problem refers to the issues that arise when:
- A function is passed as an argument to another function.
- JavaScript has to decide which scope the function remembers when executed.

This can happen in closures, causing confusion over which variables/functions are retained.

---

### How does `this` work in arrow functions?

Arrow functions do **not** have their own `this`. Instead, they inherit `this` from their outer (lexical) scope.

Example:
```javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.greet = () => console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}`);
}
const person = new Person("John");
person.greet(); // Hello, John
```

In the example above, `this` refers to the `Person` object due to lexical scope.

---

### Why do we need JSON?

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** is a lightweight data-interchange format. It's needed because:
1. It provides a standard way to exchange data between server and client.
2. It is easy to parse and generate in almost all programming languages.
3. It is lightweight and human-readable compared to XML or other formats.

Example Usage:
- Fetching data from an API and parsing it as an object with `JSON.parse()`.
- Sending data to a server in string format using `JSON.stringify()`.

---

### **What is the purpose of the array `slice()` method?**

The `slice()` method is used to extract a portion of an array into a new array, without modifying the original array. 

**Syntax:**
```javascript
array.slice(startIndex, endIndex);
```

- **startIndex**: Starting index (inclusive).
- **endIndex**: Ending index (exclusive).

**Example:**
```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const sliceArr = arr.slice(1, 4); // [2, 3, 4]
console.log(arr); // Original array remains unchanged: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

---

### **What is the purpose of the array `splice()` method?**

The `splice()` method is used to add, remove, or replace elements in an array. **It modifies the original array.**

**Syntax:**
```javascript
array.splice(startIndex, deleteCount, item1, item2, ...);
```

- **startIndex**: Index to start changing the array.
- **deleteCount**: Number of elements to remove.
- **item1, item2, ...**: Elements to add.

**Example:**
```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
arr.splice(1, 2, "a", "b"); // [2, 3] removed, replaced with "a", "b"
console.log(arr); // [1, "a", "b", 4, 5]
```

---

### **List array methods that mutate the source array**

These array methods **modify the original array**:
1. `splice()`
2. `push()`
3. `pop()`
4. `shift()`
5. `unshift()`
6. `reverse()`
7. `sort()`
8. `fill()`

---

### **List array methods that return a new array**

These methods **do not modify the original array** and return a new array:
1. `slice()`
2. `map()`
3. `filter()`
4. `concat()`
5. `reduce()` (indirectly, by returning any object/array)
6. `flat()`
7. `flatMap()`

---

### **What is a first-class function?**

Functions in JavaScript are **first-class citizens**, meaning:
- They can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.

Example:
```javascript
const greet = () => console.log("Hello");
const execute = (fn) => fn();
execute(greet); // Hello
```

---

### **What is a first-order function?**

A **first-order function** is a function that does not take other functions as arguments or returns functions.

Example:
```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

---

### **What is a higher-order function?**

A **higher-order function** is a function that:
1. Takes another function as an argument, or
2. Returns another function.

Example:
```javascript
function multiplier(factor) {
  return (x) => x * factor;
}

const double = multiplier(2);
console.log(double(5)); // 10
```

---

### **What is a unary function?**

A **unary function** is a function that takes exactly **one argument**.

Example:
```javascript
const square = (x) => x ** 2;
console.log(square(4)); // 16
```

---

### **What is currying?**

**Currying** is a technique where a function takes **one argument at a time** and returns another function expecting the next argument.

Example:
```javascript
function add(a) {
  return (b) => a + b;
}
console.log(add(2)(3)); // 5
```

---

### **What is an anonymous function?**

An **anonymous function** is a function without a name. It is often used in places where the name is not required, such as callbacks.

Example:
```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.forEach(function (num) {
  console.log(num);
});
```

### **What does `Promise.all()` do?**

`Promise.all()` accepts an array of promises and returns a single promise that:
1. Resolves: When all promises in the array are resolved.
2. Rejects: If any promise in the array fails.

**Example:**
```javascript
const promise1 = Promise.resolve("A");
const promise2 = Promise.resolve("B");
Promise.all([promise1, promise2]).then((results) => console.log(results)); // ["A", "B"]
```

---

### **What is the difference between `Promise.all` and `Promise.allSettled`?**

| **`Promise.all`**                      | **`Promise.allSettled`**                 |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Resolves once all promises are fulfilled. | Resolves after all promises are settled (fulfilled or rejected). |
| Rejects if any promise fails.          | Does not reject, but returns the status of each promise. |
| Example: Results only for successful promises. | Example: Includes status for successful and failed promises. |

**Example:**
```javascript
Promise.allSettled([
  Promise.resolve("A"),
  Promise.reject("Error"),
]).then((results) => console.log(results));
```
Output:
```javascript
[
  { status: "fulfilled", value: "A" },
  { status: "rejected", reason: "Error" }
]
```

---

### **What is the purpose of `Promise.race()`?**

`Promise.race()` returns a promise which settles (fulfills or rejects) as soon as any promise in the array settles.

**Example:**
```javascript
const promise1 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100, "A"));
const promise2 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 200, "B"));

Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then((result) => console.log(result)); // "A"
```

---

### **What is strict mode in JavaScript?**

`"use strict";` enforces stricter parsing and error handling in JavaScript:
- Prevents accidental global variables.
- Disallows duplicate parameter names.
- Disables `this` referring to `window` in the global scope.

Example:
```javascript
"use strict";
x = 10; // ReferenceError: x is not defined
```

---

### **What are PWAs?**

**Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)** are web applications with modern capabilities that:
1. Work offline using service workers.
2. Are installable (appear like native apps).
3. Provide app-like interactions with responsive design.

---

### **What is memoization?**

Memoization is an optimization technique where results of expensive function calls are **cached** to avoid redundant computations.

Example:
```javascript
function memoize(fn) {
  const cache = {};
  return (arg) => cache[arg] || (cache[arg] = fn(arg));
}

const factorial = memoize((n) => (n <= 1 ? 1 : n * factorial(n - 1)));
console.log(factorial(5)); // Returns cached results
```

---

### **How do you encode a URL?**

Use `encodeURIComponent()` for encoding component-specific parts of a URL.

Example:
```javascript
const url = "example.com?name=John Doe";
console.log(encodeURIComponent(url)); // example.com%3Fname%3DJohn%20Doe
```

---

### **How do you decode a URL?**

Use `decodeURIComponent()` for decoding component-specific parts of a URL.

Example:
```javascript
const encodedUrl = "example.com%3Fname%3DJohn%20Doe";
console.log(decodeURIComponent(encodedUrl)); // example.com?name=John Doe
```

---

### **How do you get the current URL with JavaScript?**

Use `window.location.href`.

Example:
```javascript
console.log(window.location.href); // Returns the full current URL
```

---

### **What is a Fetch API?**

**Fetch API** is a modern interface for making HTTP requests.
- Returns a `Promise`.
- Provides cleaner and consistent syntax compared to `XMLHttpRequest`.

Example:
```javascript
fetch("https://api.example.com")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.error("Error:", error));
```

---

### **How to open a two-way interactive session between browser and server?**

Use **WebSockets** to open a two-way communication channel between browser and server.

Example:
```javascript
const socket = new WebSocket("ws://example.com/socket");
socket.onopen = () => console.log("Connection opened");
socket.onmessage = (event) => console.log("Message:", event.data);
socket.send("Hello Server!");
```

---

### **How to abort an async operation?**

Use the **AbortController** to cancel `fetch()` or other async operations.

Example:
```javascript
const controller = new AbortController();
const signal = controller.signal;

fetch("https://api.example.com", { signal })
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((err) => console.log("Fetch aborted"));

controller.abort(); // Cancels the fetch request
```

## Good to know areas

### **How do you create an object with prototype?**

You can create an object with a specific prototype using either:
1. **`Object.create()`**
2. **Prototype assignment in constructor functions or ES6 classes**

**Using `Object.create()`:**
```javascript
const parentObj = {
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello from Parent!");
  },
};

const childObj = Object.create(parentObj);
childObj.greet(); // Hello from Parent!
```

**Using Constructor Functions:**
```javascript
function Parent() {
  this.name = "Parent";
}
Parent.prototype.greet = function () {
  console.log("Hello!");
};

const child = new Parent();
child.greet(); // Hello!
```

---

### **What is a proxy object?**

A **proxy object** in JavaScript is created using the `Proxy` constructor, which allows you to redefine or intercept default operations (e.g., property access, assignment). 

**Syntax:**
```javascript
const proxy = new Proxy(targetObject, handlerObject);
```

**Example:**
```javascript
const target = { name: "John" };
const handler = {
  get: (obj, prop) => {
    return prop in obj ? obj[prop] : "Property not found";
  },
};

const proxy = new Proxy(target, handler);
console.log(proxy.name); // "John"
console.log(proxy.age); // "Property not found"
```

---

### **How do you define JSON arrays?**

JSON arrays are similar to JavaScript arrays, except their values are structured as JSON objects.

**Example:**
```json
[
  { "id": 1, "name": "John" },
  { "id": 2, "name": "Jane" },
  { "id": 3, "name": "Doe" }
]
```

You can access the elements programmatically:
```javascript
const jsonArray = [
  { id: 1, name: "John" },
  { id: 2, name: "Jane" },
];
console.log(jsonArray[1].name); // "Jane"
```

---

### **What is Tree Shaking?**

**Tree shaking** is a technique used by JavaScript bundlers like **Webpack** to optimize code by removing unused modules or exports.

- It relies on **ES6 module syntax** (`import`/`export`).
- Reduces the final bundle size.

**Example:**
```javascript
// utils.js
export const usedFunction = () => {};
export const unusedFunction = () => {};
```

When `unusedFunction` isn't imported elsewhere in the code, tree shaking removes it from the final bundle.

---

### **How do you detect JavaScript disabled on a page?**

You can detect JavaScript is disabled by including a `<noscript>` tag, which renders content if JavaScript is disabled.

**Example:**
```html
<noscript>
  <p>JavaScript is disabled. Please enable JavaScript for full functionality.</p>
</noscript>
```

Alternatively, you can use server-side methods to display alternate content if JavaScript is disabled.

---

### **How do you detect a mobile browser?**

You can detect a mobile browser by checking the **`navigator.userAgent`** string for mobile-specific identifiers.

**Example:**
```javascript
function isMobileBrowser() {
  const userAgent = navigator.userAgent || navigator.vendor || window.opera;
  return /android|iphone|ipad|mobile/i.test(userAgent);
}

console.log(isMobileBrowser()); // true or false
```

---

### **How can we draw something in the browser?**

You can draw shapes, graphics, or text using the **`<canvas>`** element and its `2D context`.

**Example: Drawing on Canvas:**
```html
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100"></canvas>
<script>
  const canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
  const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

  // Draw a rectangle
  ctx.fillStyle = "blue";
  ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 150, 50);

  // Draw a circle
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.arc(75, 75, 50, 0, Math.PI * 2);
  ctx.fillStyle = "red";
  ctx.fill();
</script>
```

---

### **How to copy value to the clipboard?**

You can use **`navigator.clipboard.writeText()`**, or older hacks that involve a hidden `<textarea>`.

**Modern Approach (Clipboard API):**
```javascript
navigator.clipboard.writeText("Hello World").then(() => {
  console.log("Copied to clipboard!");
});
```

**Fallback (Textarea Method):**
```javascript
function copyToClipboard(text) {
  const textarea = document.createElement("textarea");
  textarea.value = text;
  document.body.appendChild(textarea);
  textarea.select();
  document.execCommand("copy");
  document.body.removeChild(textarea);
}
copyToClipboard("Hello World");
```

---

### **How to read value from the clipboard?**

You can use **`navigator.clipboard.readText()`**.

**Example:**
```javascript
navigator.clipboard.readText().then((text) => {
  console.log("Clipboard content:", text);
});
```

Ensure you have proper permissions for clipboard access in the user's browser.
