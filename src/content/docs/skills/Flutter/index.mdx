  Person(this.name, this.age);

  void greet() {
    print('Hello, my name is $name');
  }
}
```

**What is this in Dart, and how is it used?**
The `this` keyword refers to the current instance of the class and is used to access the properties or methods of the class.

**What are getter and setter in Dart, and how to use them?**
Getters and setters are used to access and change the value of a property. Example:

```dart
class Person {
  String _name;

  Person(this._name);

  String get name => _name;
  set name(String newName) => _name = newName;
}
```

  a = Dog();
  a.makeSound(); // Bark
  a = Cat();
  a.makeSound(); // Meow
}
```

**What is encapsulation in Dart, and how to use it?**
Encapsulation hides a class's internal data and methods, providing only the necessary interface using private and public access control. Example:

```dart
class Person {
  String _name; // private field

  Person(this._name);

  String get name => _name; // getter
  set name(String newName) => _name = newName; // setter
}
```

**How does abstraction work in Dart?**
Abstraction hides unnecessary details and provides only essential information, achieved using abstract classes and interfaces. Example:

```dart
abstract class Shape {
  void draw(); // Abstract method
}

class Circle extends Shape {
  @override
  void draw() {
    print('Drawing a circle');
  }
}
```

**How to use interface in Dart?**
In Dart, an interface is implemented using classes. A Dart class can implement one or more interfaces. Example:

```dart
class Shape {
  void draw();
}

class Circle implements Shape {
  @override
  void draw() {
    print('Drawing a circle');
  }
}
```

**Difference between abstract class and interface in Dart?**
An abstract class provides partial implementation and cannot be inherited by multiple classes, while an interface can be implemented by multiple classes and provides a complete implementation.
